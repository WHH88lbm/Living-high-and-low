## Description
The family lives in India. S is 40 years old and is a fruit collector. His wife B is 30 years old and they have 4 children. Their two sons are L, age 10, and N, age 6, and the two daughters are R, age 7, and H, age 3. All the children are out of school. S works 84 hours/week. The family lives in a one-room house built on encroached land. The house was constructed with help from friends and family about 10 years ago. It has no electricity, no water, and no toilet. The worst thing about the house is that their water source is 2.5 km away and isn’t safe to drink. S spends over 17 hours per week fetching water for the family’s use. Nearly all of the family income is spent on purchasing food. Suresh also spends 4 hours every week to collect wood for cooking. The family doesn’t save money. Their most treasured possession is their phone. S hopes one day to purchase a plot of land, and dreams of having a home with a well or water pump.
