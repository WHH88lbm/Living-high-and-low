## Description
Family lives in India. B, 55 years old, is a working professional and his wife H, 48 years old, stays at home. They have a daughter who got married last year. The family lives in a rented 3 bedroom apartment and has been living here for 5 years. They like the apartment because of its quality and its close proximity to their relatives, however, they dislike its location. Their apartment has uninterrupted electricity, indoor toilet facility, and safe water supply. The family buys all their food supplies from the market and spends around 50% of their income on it. They cook their food on LPG fuel. Drinking water is also available at their home and is safe to drink. The family has been on vacations and has travelled as far as New York, USA. Their favorite item in the house is their mobile phone. The family is saving money and the next big thing they plan on buying is a double door refrigerator. Their dream is to someday own a luxury Audi car.
