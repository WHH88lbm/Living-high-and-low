## Description
<p>The family lives in Cambodia. S is 30 years old and is a teacher. His wife K is 28 years old and is also a teacher. They live with two children: the niece, D is 15 years old and son, R is 2 years old. Also living with the family are the grandparents: C, 65 years old and M, 70 years old. M spends 20 hours a week looking after the household. S and his wife work 85 hours a week. The family lives in a four-room house and have been living here for the past 5 years. Their house has electricity, safe drinking water, and their own toilet. Buying food costs them 40% of their income and they use electricity for cooking purposes. With money left over after buying food, the family is able to save. They are planning to buy a house. They hope one day to be able to fulfil their dream of buying a car.</p>
