## Description
The family lives in China. B is 57 years old and is a business owner. His wife, Y, is also 57 years old and they live with their niece and her family. Their niece, M, is 30 years old. M’s family includes her 39-year-old husband, J, and their 3-year-old son, S. The adults all work together in the family business, putting in a combined 240 hours every week. The family lives in a three-bedroom house. They own the house and have been living there for the past 6 years. They like it because it’s close to their workplace and has a nice morning view, but the only thing they aren’t happy with is its small size. The house has uninterrupted electricity, water, and toilet facilities. The family purchases all their food supplies from the local market, which costs 30% of their income. The drinking water is purchased from the market and gets delivered to their house. In the kitchen, they use electricity to power the stove. The family is saving money for their future. Their favorite items in the house are their musical instruments.
